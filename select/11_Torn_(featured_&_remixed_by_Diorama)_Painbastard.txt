I had no time to prepare myself
Just like a bang fades into silence
You disappeared - got lost in tragedy
My hands were tied, I watched it all pass by

Since you've forsaken me - I lost my wings
And my heart and mind are so numb with cold

The hole in my life - you left behind
The piece of my heart - you ripped out
They cannot keep me from resurrecting
I won't waste time - I have only this one life

Since you've forsaken me - I lost my wings
I've lost too much but I have found myself

Since you've forsaken me - I lost my wings
And I try to escape - 'cause I am torn
With every thought I'll vanish into grief
And then again I will arise
